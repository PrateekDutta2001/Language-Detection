# Language-Detection

It is an NLP system. The sensitivity score is quite high and the accuracy score is in a very advantageous position. It has 97% accuracy and 98.4% sensitivity score. I share Dataset and Artificial Intelligence Software as open source. I used the Ridge Classifier algorithm and manipulated the dataset to improve the algorithm. In this way, the sensitivity rate and score of the software has been increased. In addition, I adapted the data according to the algorithm and made the algorithm work. In this study, it was studied on the data, not on the algorithm.

It contains 22 languages and out of that it can detect which language does the user inserts.
